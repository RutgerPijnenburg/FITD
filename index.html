          <p class="Text">
            From Idea to Design was a course in the first quartile, it was the
            first real design project I had a part in, and in this project there
            were a couple of things I have to reflect on. The first thing was my
            part in the group, I was responsible for a big part of the
            technology and realization, making models, logos, animations and
            code, the reason why I have to reflect on this is because I did not
            have a say in what I had to do, or in how much time I spent. I did
            not really speak up for myself, doing a lot of work, which, at times
            made me feel stressed or annoyed, as I was doing a lot of work, work
            that was not even necessary, while there were others not doing
            anything. This caused me to have little time to do stuff that I
            wanted to do, but it also caused us to stray from what we actually
            needed to do. Next time I will have to do things differently, the
            most obvious alternative is speaking up, something that is difficult
            for me and something I still have to work on, speaking up comes with
            positives and negatives, it causes me to have a more active role,
            which feels really draining for me, it also makes me look more
            controlling. On the flip side, it could have caused me to have to
            spend less time. For me to do this I will have to learn to
            communicate better, which ties into one of the goals I have set, I
            will go to my culture association once a week, where I will talk to
            at least two people.
